		<p>Hey, I'm McKay, an amateur programmer and professional fry cook. I'm a recent high school graduate and I've been 
		coding as a hobby and for classes for about 3 years now. I mostly code in HTML and CSS, but have dabbled in Java-based games.
		In addition to coding, I enjoy playing tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, as well as playing guitar,
		and have managed to convince a few friends to form a band, though it's been largely inactive until recently as a result of most of us being students.
		This website is intended to serve as a portfolio for my Client-Side Programming class and may eventually be repurposed to serve as a general portfolio.
